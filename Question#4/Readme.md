Files:

main.cpp: file with the unit test parametrizations
libConcatRemove.cpp : source code of each function for the ConcatRemove
libConcatRemove.hpp : header file of the functions
acutest.hpp : header file of the "acutest" unit test framework employed. It is opensource and do not have dependencies, so it was straightforward to use on the onlinegdb platform.


Solution Description:

The library (source code and header file) created in the previous question was used in this one. For this question two sets of tests were created:

1. Test the constraints return exceptions, to validate the exception triggers are correct.

2. Checking if the results are the excpected ones in situations with knwon results.

Insert "-v" on the command line arguments and click on run. The "-v" prints detailed results of the unit test.
