Solution:

Encapsulation is a property of Objected-Oriented Programming that bundles data and methods that operates in this data inside a class. It is often used to hide attributes, and keep information inside the class or object, without being acessible outside the class, but that can be used inside methods.

Generalization is the property of extracting and sharing attributes from subclassess and combining them into a superclass.

Method overload occurs when a class have more than one method with the same name, but with different arguments.

Multiple inheritance is a feature of when a class or object is based on more than one base classes or objects, retaining similar properties, atributes and methods from the bases. It creates relationships among different classes.

Polymorphism is occurs as a type of inheritance from parent classes that can perform differnent tasks and still have the same name. 


In the example given, it is clearly a case of Polymorphism, since the objects are assigned using different classes, and the same method, when applied to such different objects, provide different results. It is similar to the method overload, but in this case applied in different classes that inherit the method from the parent class.
